  You can modify templateId or ownerType in the code if needed.  
- Reports are saved in the same directory as main.py under the name report.csv.  
- Ensure your API user has permissions in GoContact to generate and download reports.  
- If the script fails to generate a filename, check your credentials, domain, and template ID.
